  My name is Travis Thomas. I graduate Allegheny College with a double-major in Economics and Computer Science. I never thought
of being a computer science major but I scheduled an introductory course sophmore year and felt it that I had found my place.
Becoming a double-major was my best choice over my college career. I love to learn it was the perfect opportunity.


### my history

I am the Father of a beautiful daughter. I was born in Dallas, Texas but have spent most of my life in Florida.  I found
Allegheny College through a football recruiting fair, my Mother recognized the name.
