My name is Travis Thomas. I graduated Allegheny College with a double-major in Economics and Computer Science in the Spring of 2018. I am the Father of a beauiful daughter.


### my history

I found Allegheny College through a football recruiting fair, my Mother recognized the name. The only two things I was sure of going into College was the fact that I was going to play football and I was going to spend the next four years putting myself in the position to provide for my family. Football was the easy part. 5a.m. lifts, meetings and practice every day, competing day in and day out... this was all natural to me. I am not taking away anything from the rigor of our program but I did not know anything else but to work hard, so it was a smooth transition.
  The hard part was deciding what I wanted to learn and get my degree in. Allegheny's curriculum and realizing all of the different opportunities I had before was overwhelming to me. I took classes in every discipline: environmental science, psychology, communications. I never thought of being a computer science major but I always had a thing for technology, albeit gaming mostly. So I scheduled an introductory computer science course sophmore year. The ever-changing field of computer science and the increasing relevance of the field drew me in and I could not of felt more relieved. Becoming a double-major was my best choice over my college career. As someone who loves to learn, the scope of the curriculum that this track provided the perfect opportunity. I was able to stick with my original economics major and study the field of computer science as well.
